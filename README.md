# Concurrent Order Processing System in Go

This tool simulates an e-commerce order processing system where multiple users can place orders concurrently. The system should handle concurrency using goroutines and mutexes to ensure that multiple orders are processed without data races. Postgres will be used to store user details, product inventory, and order records.
